<!-- Part 1:
HTTP is the standard protocol by which server requests are made
A URL is the link that references the resource desired by the server
DNS is the system by which websites are given a human-readable name. It references the IP address of the server hosting the site and the specific address to the resource. 
A query string is the tag at the end of a GET request that invokes a search of the site.
GET and POST are two HTTP verbs. GET requests information from the server. POST submits information to the server that changes the information stored on it.
An HTTP request is a submission to a server for information regarding specific resources
An HTTP response is what the browser returns from the HTTP request.
An HTTP header is used to specify the data being sent to and from the server. Request header examples are: user-agent, accept-language, cache-control, connection, host, if-none-match. Response header examples are: accept-ranges, cache-control, connection, date, last-modified.
A request is sent through your router to a local DNS server. The DNS server finds the IP address for the server associated with the site you are attempting to reach and send a request to it. The site server then processes the request and sends information back to your browser where you can access it.
